# Art
Art can be added to the *Art* folder until it is organized in the project assets folder for actual program use. PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs are probably best for web.

# Proj Management
For this project, DEVs (probably just myself - Andrew) should create new branches to organize their code. For files being added to the *Art* folder, however, there is no need for this. These files can just be committed (added) directly to the art folder by entering it and dragging and dropping the file. You shouldn't even need to put the repo on your PC and deal with cloning/merging or anything. If you want to, however, then I'd suggest GitHub Desktop application.
